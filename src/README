DEPENDENCIES

INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just use make install.
For now we are using a hard-installing way
because i just do not know how to use autotools yet.
If you do not install as superuser the "install"
macro will create a couple of dirs in your home:
~/lib/
~/bin/
so you must export the environment variables to use the program:
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/lib/
if you install as superuser, the "install" macro will install
on /usr/lib and /usr/bin paths.
